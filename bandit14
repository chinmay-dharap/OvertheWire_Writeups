Bandit Level 13 → Level 14
Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14.
For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level.
Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on


Solution:
---------

Very Easy. They have given a ssh private key and not the password which makes it so much easier. 
Just use the private key to login with ssh command. 

Command: 

ssh -i ssh.private_key bandit14@bandit.labs.overthwire.org -p 2220
