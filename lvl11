Using passwd from bandit10 access bandit11: 

- The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and
uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions

Solution: 
---------

This is basically Rot13 Algorithm for encoding decoding text. In this algorithm the basic Alphabets
are replaced by their shift 13 value. This can either be done by using a rot13 tool or just using
tr command to replace characters. 

Command: 

cat data.txt | tr '[a-zA-Z]' '[n-za-mN-ZA-M]'

- This command will basically replace the 13th shift value for the original alphabet. for. e.g
A -> N or a -> n
