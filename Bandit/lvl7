Using passwd found in previous bandit6, access bandit7, Once accessed:

Solution: 
---------

Very Easy. There is a single data.txt file which has so much data. And the level goal says the
password is next to the word "millionth". So we'll be using grep to locate the word. And Tadahh!


Command: 

cat data.txt | grep millionth


Password: dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc
