Using the passwd found in bandit7 access the bandit8, once accessed: 

- The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that
occurs only once

Solution: 
---------

In this level, there is a data.txt file which has alot of lines of text. Maybe alot of duplicates
too. The level goal tells us that there is one line which is unique and has not been repeated and
the password is in that line. So we will be using two commands: sort and uniq to sort the file
alphabetically first and then find out the unique lines.

Command: 

sort data.txt | uniq -u
