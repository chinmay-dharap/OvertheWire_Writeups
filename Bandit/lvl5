Using passwd found in previous bandit4 access bandit5, and Once you access Bandit5: 

- The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

    human-readable
    1033 bytes in size
    not executable

Solution: 
---------

The directory inhere has more than 15 folders. It is time consuming to check all the folders for
these conditions above. Rather just smartly use ls command correctly to show all the files at once.

Once you see all the hidden files and file sizes, just by looking at it you can see a single file
from all those folder which is of size 1033 bytes. Now other two conditions has to be true about
this file because there is no other file with the same file size. 

So that's our file!

Commands: 

1. ls -la (this will give you a list of details)
2. cd maybehere07/
3. ls -la (this will show you the hidden file named .file2)
4. cat -- .file2 (to show the contents of the file)
