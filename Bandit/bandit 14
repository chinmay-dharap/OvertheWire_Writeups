Bandit Level 14 â†’ Level 15
Level Goal

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.


Solution:
---------

Theory: 

nc or netcat is a command that allows to read and write data over a network connection. It can be used for TCP and UDP connections. To connect to a service (as client) on a network the command syntax is the following: nc <host> <port>. To create a server that listens to incoming packets, the command looks like this: nc -l <port>.


- So use nc to submit the current level password to get next password. 

Command: 

nc localhost 30000
