Use the Password found in Bandit0 to access Level1 i.e ssh into bandit1

- Passoword to access level 2 is store in a file called - located in the home directory 

Solution: 
---------

File name is -
It is actually a standard output so you can't read it directly. 

Use this command : cat < -

This is usually interpreted as "read from the standard input (stdin)". 

< : This is an input redirection operator in the shell.
It tells the shell to take input from a file (or sometimes from another source) 
instead of the standard input (which would usually be typed directly into the terminal).
