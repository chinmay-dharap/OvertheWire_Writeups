Using the passwd in the previous level bandit5 access bandit6, once you access bandit6: 

- The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following 
properties:

    owned by user bandit7
    owned by group bandit6
    33 bytes in size

This level teaches how to use find command effectively when you have multiple properties to look
for in a file. 

find command offers multiple arguments. From them we will be using -type to specify the file type, 
-user for specifiying which user owns that file, -group for specifiying which group owns that file
and lastly -size for size of the file. 

Command: 

bandit6@bandit:~$ find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null

Here, command will search through root directoy as we have specified it at the start (/). Also
without the last part (2>/dev/null) the command will spit out alot of Permission denied errors as
there are some directories which are out of bound for out user.

Let me break it down:

"2": In Unix-like systems, file descriptors represent different kinds of input and output.

"1" is the standard output (stdout), which is used for regular output (e.g., the content that
a program prints).

"2" is the standard error (stderr), which is used for error messages or other diagnostic output.

">": This is the output redirection operator. It tells the shell to redirect the output of a command 
to a different location instead of printing it to the terminal. In this case, it redirects stderr.

"/dev/null": This is a special device file. Anything written to /dev/null is simply discarded, 
i.e., it is thrown away and doesn’t get displayed. 
It’s often referred to as a “bit bucket” or “black hole.”

- What 2>/dev/null Does:

2>/dev/null means "redirect any error messages (stderr) to /dev/null," which effectively hides them.
Any errors generated by the command will not appear in the terminal.
